## üí° Key Algorithms & Concepts

- **Two Pointer Technique**: Used in string merging, vowel reversal, word processing, in-place compression, array partitioning, subsequence matching, area maximization, and k-sum pair finding
- **Sliding Window Technique**: Fixed-size and variable-size window optimization for subarray/substring problems with efficient add/remove operations
- **Variable-Size Sliding Window**: Dynamic window expansion and contraction based on conditions (e.g., maintaining constraint while maximizing window size)
- **Sliding Window with Deletion Constraint**: Special case where at most k elements can be flipped/deleted to maximize subarray length
- **Character Counting in Windows**: Tracking specific character types (vowels) within sliding windows
- **Hash Map Operations**: Frequency counting, complement search, and O(1) lookup for pair finding
- **GCD Algorithm**: Applied to string lengths for finding common divisors
- **Linear Search**: Finding maximum elements in arrays
- **Boolean Array Operations**: Efficient result storage
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Optimal flower placement, subsequence tracking, and container selection with local decisions
- **Boundary Condition Handling**: Edge cases for array start/end positions
- **Character Classification**: Efficient vowel detection using direct comparison and lambda functions
- **In-Place String Modification**: Memory-efficient string manipulation and compression
- **String Parsing**: Handling whitespace and word extraction
- **Backward Traversal**: Processing strings from end to beginning
- **Prefix/Suffix Arrays**: Computing cumulative products for array transformations
